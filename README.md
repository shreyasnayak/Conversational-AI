## About The Project

Conversational AI has always held the promise of natural, human-like interaction. With the rapid advancements in **Transformer-based LLMs**, new possibilities have emerged in how we build AI systems. This project is an experimental attempt to create a **voice-driven conversational AI**, moving beyond traditional chatbots and text interfaces to enable real-time voice interactions.

Currently, this project is **private**, but here are a few highlights of the progress made so far:

🎤 Real-time voice input and output  
📞 Integration with VoIP (Voice over IP) and SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)  
🧠 Transformer-based AI models for conversation  
🎙️ Voice Activity Detection (VAD) algorithms  
🎛️ Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques
